# Welcome to Enthusiast

**Enthusiast** is an open-source, production-oriented agentic AI framework built specifically for **e-commerce workflows**.

If you want to attach RAG-powered agents to product catalogs, customer support flows, or content pipelines — with the option to self-host everything — **Enthusiast is worth exploring.**

## What is Enthusiast?

  :::info Framework Overview
  Enthusiast is a production-ready agentic AI framework specifically designed for e-commerce environments.
  :::

  Enthusiast combines:
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with vector search capabilities
  - **Layered validation** to reduce AI hallucinations
  - **Pre-built e-commerce connectors** for PIM/CMS/Shopify integration
  - Support for both **cloud-based and self-hosted** language models
  - **Python/Django backend** with React frontend

  :::tip Why Choose Enthusiast?
  Unlike general-purpose AI frameworks, Enthusiast is optimized for product catalogs, customer support, and e-commerce workflows out of the box.
  :::
  
## Key Features

### RAG + Vector Index
Build a vectorized index of product pages, docs, and PIM exports, then answer free-form questions with contextually retrieved evidence.

### Validation & Evaluation
Layered scoring and optional LLM-based validators help detect inconsistencies and reduce hallucinations.

### E-Commerce Connectors
Pre-built connectors simplify ingest from common sources (PIM/CMS/Shopify/others) to get real product data into the index faster.

### Flexible Model Integrations
Use OpenAI-hosted models or self-hosted LLMs (Mistral, LLaMA, Deepseek, etc.) depending on security and cost constraints.

## Common Use Cases

- Knowledge bases for sales & support
- Semi-automated customer support
- Content generation (ads, product descriptions)
